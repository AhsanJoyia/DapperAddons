# DapperAddons

Dapper is an objectâ€“relational mapping product for the Microsoft .NET platform: it provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database. Its purpose is to relieve the developer from a significant portion of relational data persistence-related programming tasks

Since the Dipper package is an open source and freely available, why do I need to create this package? Well, you're right. The main purpose behind DapperAddons is to provide convincing, concise methods so that developers become more productive.

What is Dapper Addons Package?
